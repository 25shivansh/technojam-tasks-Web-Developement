# Introduction

Hello Everyone!  
My name is **Shivansh Singh**, and I'm currently pursuing my **BTech** in **Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)** with a graduation year of **2027**. I'm passionate about web development and currently focusing on the **MERN stack**.

## Easy Task

In the easy task, I developed a **Card Component** using modern technologies such as **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. 

- **React** allowed me to create a reusable and dynamic component.
- **Tailwind CSS** made the design process smooth and efficient, enabling me to write inline styles directly, resulting in faster development and cleaner code.

The component showcases a sleek card design that is fully responsive and customizable.

## Hard Task

For the hard task, I created an authentication system using **Express** and **JWT (JSON Web Token)**. The application features three main endpoints:

### 1. **/signup**  
   - Takes **username** and **password** from the request body.
   - Creates a new user and securely stores the credentials in the database.

### 2. **/signin**  
   - Authenticates the user by comparing the provided **username** and **password** with the database.
   - If credentials match, a **JWT token** is generated and sent in the response.

### 3. **/me**  
   - Requires a valid **JWT token** in the request header.
   - Verifies the token using the **JWT_SECRET** and retrieves user information if the token is valid.

This setup ensures secure authentication and authorization, with JWT playing a crucial role in protecting the user data.
